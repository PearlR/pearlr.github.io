                <h3>99 Problems and code is one... Hundred percent all of them.</h3>

                <h4>What was the problem?</h4>
                <p>I've had so many problems but the two I most frequently suffer from are syntaxing issues and not understanding where to start.</p>

                <h4>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h4>
                <p>I like to try console logging in the Chrome inspector or on a website like codepen.io. I also like to do the rubber ducky technique or the 'explain your problem to a five year old' technique to help simplify a problem. And psuedo code. Psuedocode the crap out of everything!</p>

                <h4>How did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
                <p>Because we're learning at such a fast rate the issues feel pretty never ending. By the time I get something it's already time to move to something else. I have brief moments of clarity and feel awesome for 2 seconds then go back to brain struggles.</p>

                <h4>What did you learn?</h4>
                <p>I like trouble shooting when I have someone to talk to - even if he is a rubber duck.</p>

                <h3>Explanations for my Non-Tech Friends</h3>

                <h4>.map()</h4>
                <p>The map method creates a new array from an existing array by changing the value input some way so that the values are different. Huh?! I hear you say... well if Johnny has 8 apples and uses the map method on them he will take each apple off the bench, makes an individual pie out of each apple, then puts the 8 individual apple pies back on the bench. Mmmm... Pie.</p>
                
                <h4>.filter()</h4>
                <p>Filter makes a new array from by filitering the values of a current array. So, Johnny has 5 pears that he wants to use the filter method on. He doesn't want any rotten pears so he filters for nice pears. 5 pears on the bench, 4 are nice but one has a nasty worm in it. We thrown the yucky one out and keep the nice 4. Yay!</p>
                
                <h4>.reduce()</h4>
                <p>The reduce method accumulates. It takes an array and applies a function to the array one variable at a time, then uses the value it creates to build on top of. It's like making a cake that you have to add the eggs slowly into. Johnny has some cake batter he needs to add 3 eggs to one by one. He cracks in the first egg. Mixes. The mixer had changed and is slighty eggier. He adds in the second egg. Mixes. The mixure is more eggy. He cracks in the final egg. Mixes. The final result is ready to get put in the oven. Splendid!</p>

                <p>This lady doesn't get it...</p>
