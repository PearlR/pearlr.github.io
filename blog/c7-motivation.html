          <h3>Wake Up. Kick Ass. Repeat.</h3>

          <h4>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h4>
          <p>When I left school (high school and university) I didn't know what I was most passionate about. I worked in jobs I didn't enjoy and felt super defeated as everyone around me kept saying "Welcome to The Real World". Over this time I definitely used other pleasure mediums (parties, shopping, food, music, drinking - all of lifes simple pleasures) to sustain my happiness weekend to weekend with "Real Work" happening in the middle. Leaving work on Friday would be such a relief.</p>

          <p>It wasn't until a few years after university, quite by accident, I started learning how to code. It wasn't long till I was hooked. I realized pretty quickly this is what working should feel like - enjoyable in its effortlessness while still being engaging and challenging. When I teach others I feel the 'flow' of doing work that is both engaging and pushes me. It's been a really long road of slogging away and trying to make ends meet to finally get to the place I am now. No one should be made to feel trapped living the way other people deem fitting.</p>

          <p> Being able to code is such a valuable, creative, empowering skill. It opened up so many opportunities for me but it wasn't until I started teaching HTML/CSS that I felt like I had found my higher purpose. I see peoples eyes light up when they realize that they too can code. When I teach others I feel like I'm glowing knowing I'm doing rewarding work that helps other people.</p>
          
          <p>We eventually came back to NZ a few months ago, one thing lead to another and I started running intro to coding workshops. I want to help other people experience the same empowerment and opportunities that I have. I'm training here at EDA to become more skilled so I can be a better teacher. Following your passion or higher purpose isn't always the easiest path but as Kermit says "It's not easy being green."</p>

          <h4>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise, what are your core values?</h4>
          <p>Happiness through appreciation. Confidence through hard work. Strength in numbers. Don't be a dick.</p>

          <h4>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise, what do you stand for?</h4>
          <p>Kindness. Loyalty. Understanding. Humour. Fun. Common sense. Girl Power. Spice up your life.</p>

          <h4>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h4>
          <p>This was quite hard for me. There has been an overwhelming amount of learning we have been doing over the past weeks - lots of feelings of failure and struggle but not as much of success or that the success felt a bit dimmed by the amount of work we still have to do. It doesn't feel as easy to shake off the negative feelings you naturally associate with failure when you don't think you've had as many successes. Celebrating the small wins may be a good way to help balance this feeling in the future.</p>
