          <h3>Wake Up. Kick Ass. Repeat.</h3>

          <h4>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h4>
          <p>When  I left school let alone university I didn't know what I was most passionate about. Not until a few years after university by accident I started doing tech/coding work. Creating with code was a skill I found useful for myself and that opened up a lot of opportunities for me. I started teaching HTML/CSS to women who wanted to learn to code. I'ed finally found my higher purpose. I decided to start running workshops for people to give them the same opportunity and to train here at EDA to become more skilled. When I teach others I feel the 'flow' of doing work that is both engaging and pushes me. It's been a really long road of slogging away and trying to make ends meet to finally getting to the place I am now where I feel like I am doing rewarding work that helps other people. I definitely used other pleasure mediums to sustain my happiness weekend to weekend with "work" happening in the middle.</p>

          <h4>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise, what are your core values?</h4>
          <p>Happiness through appreciation. Confidence through hard work. Strength in numbers. Don't be a dick.</p>

          <h4>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise, what do you stand for?</h4>
          <p>Kindness. Loyalty. Understanding. Humour. Fun. Common sense.</p>

          <h4>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h4>
          <p>This was quite hard for me. There has been an overwhelming amount of learning we have been doing over the past weeks - lots of feelings of failure and struggle but not as much of success or that the success felt a bit dimmed by the amount of work we still have to do. It's not as easy to shake the feeling of a failure when you don't think you've resolved it yet.</p>
