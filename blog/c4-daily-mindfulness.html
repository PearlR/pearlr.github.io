                <h3>Mind the gap</h3>
                 
                 <h4>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'?</h4>
                 <p>Repeating what someone said is a technique that I've been taught before as a mechanism to make sure you're understanding someone fully. What is different about the Looping technique is that it is more thorough </p>

                <h4>How did the other person find it?</h4>
                 <p>Joolz was a champ! Her feedback: Repeating the conversation back expresses that your actively listening and trying to understand. Asked for more informations for confirmation around clarity of understanding which then lead to an offer of help.</p>

                <h4>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h4>
                <p>I like the buddy system. I'm quite a fan of team work as it makes me more aware of being accountable and creates strong motivation to stay on track.</p>

                <p>Even though I like to practice daily mindfulness we all have this awesome habit of not doing the things we enjoy that we know are good for us in favour of the things that are crappy and totally suck! Yay US! The one mindful breath a day is awesome. It makes me feel like, even when I'm stressed out or feeling like crap, that I've at least taken one moment out of the day for my for wellbeing. I like being a well being.</p>

                <h4>Any other musings?</h4>
                <p>Practice makes perfect. BUT - perfection is the result of practicing - not the action of practicing. And, even though the action may be simple, it's so hard to get right. Still with me? It's all good - keep practicing.</p>
