                    <h3>Don't be a dick</h3>

                    <h4>What learnings did you take from the chapter? </h4>
                    <p>Duuuuude… It was at the point where the Google good fellow started talking about zoning out that I then realized I had zoned out. I quickly snapped back to attention and was rewarded with him telling me that if I had realized that I had zoned out that I was making progress because acknowledgment of said zoning strengthens the mind muscles and you'll do it less often.
                    <br/>
                    <br/> 
                    If anything the video reminded me that you have to accept that you have a problem and then be conscientious of it - aware. And that to me right there is the crux of emotional intelligence. Being conscientious and aware of other people as thinking feeling beings. As Maia Angelo said:
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <em>
                    “I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”
                    </em>
                    </p>
                    <h4>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h4>
                    <p>Mindfulness is very important to me. I practice mindfulness everyday in the morning and in the small moments that I get free during the day. Coding especially can be very mentally draining and it’s very easy to lose focus. Mindfulness stops the brain chaos and gets you back to your zen place :)</p>
