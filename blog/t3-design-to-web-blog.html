                    <h3>It's Alive!</h3>

                    <h4>What is a responsive site, and why responsiveness is important</h4>
                    <p>Everyone has a different sized computer, tablet, phone etc that they may be looking at your website from. Responsive website design means that a website will adjust itself to best fit the screen size that you aare looking at it in. This is important because it means that no matter how your website is being accessed the information will be presented in an easy to use an understand format.</p>
                    <h4>What is mobile first design, and why it's important</h4>
                    <p>Mobile first design is a design approach where a website is made for smaller screen sizes before larger. This is an important approach because it forces a website designer to organize the content of the website before focusing on beautifying the website.</p>
                    <h4>What are frameworks, and their pros and cons</h4>
                    <p>A framework (or boiler plate) is made up of code that you can utilize to build out the main structure of a website. We used one called <a href"http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a>. By using premade tags, classes and snippets of code that will determine things like layout, form fields, typography and responsiveness you can quickly and efficiently build a website.</p>

                    <table class="u-full-width centered>">
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Pro's</th>
                            <th>Con's</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Responsive</td>
                            <td>Can be limiting</td>
                        </tr>
                            <td>Fast clean code building</td>
                            <td>Can stop people from actually coding</td>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Good Support from most framework owners</td>
                            <td>Opensource code can be an easier for hackers to target</td>
                        </tr>

                    <h4>What a wireframe is and why we use it</h4>
                    <p>A wireframe is a sketch of your website design that lays out basic elements of your website with a stronger focus on content/functionality over design.</p>

                    <div class="u-full-width centered">
                        
                        <img src="../images/image1.JPG" alt="wireframe-1" class="wireframe" width="200px">
                        <img src="../images/image2.JPG" alt="wireframe-2" class="wireframe" width="200px">
                        <img src="../images/image3.JPG" alt="wireframe-3" class="wireframe" width="200px">
                        <img src="../images/image4.JPG" alt="wireframe-4" class="wireframe" width="200px">
                        <img src="../images/image5.JPG" alt="wireframe-5" class="wireframe" width="200px">
                        <img src="../images/image6.JPG" alt="wireframe-6" class="wireframe" width="200px">

                    </div>

                    <h4>The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why</h4>
                    <p>Following the wireframe full stop. I don't have these issues when I make a webpage for someone else but if it's something for myself I change my mind 20x before settling on anything. I realized I had forgotten to add the quote section that I wanted, I didn't like the side bar menu I came up with, decided I wanted a header image... This basically sums it up...</p>
