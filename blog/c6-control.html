          <h3>There is no spoon</h3>

          <h4>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h4>
          
          <p>Ok! These are some of the cool things that I learned that I want to share. A lot of these points are a bit regurgitaty of the chapter but they are points worth sharing and elaborating on.</p>
          
          <h4>Choice</h4>

          <p>Daniel Goleman identifies five emotional competencies under the domain of self-regulation that all have one underpinning theme: Choice. It's important for people to recognize when they have a choice in how they are letting their feelings about their feelings control them. You feel something, that makes you feel something about those feelings and now you have to figure out how to feel about the feels. It's feelings inception.</p>
          <ol>
           <li>Self-control: Keeping disruptive emotions and impulses in check</li>
           <li>Trustworthiness: Maintaining standards of honesty and integrity</li>
           <li>Conscientiousness: Taking responsibility for personal performance</li>
           <li>Adaptability: Flexibility in handling change</li>
           <li>Innovation: Being comfortable with novel ideas, approaches, and information</li>
         </ol>

         <h4>Attitude</h4>          
         <p>Grasping and aversion are very common. When I was reading about them I was all like "Oh hell yes! That is totally a thing!". We are awesome at self-sabotaging and we wreck a lot of good things. Thich Nhat Hanh: Wilting flowers do not cause suffering. Don't taint a good thing. Let go of all the nastiness. Do an Elsa!</p>

         <h4>Dealing with the Demons</h4>
         <p>Ok, so one thought that I had at the beginning of the chapter was "How does this work when you feelings are crazy intense and you don't feel like you can rain them in?". I mean sure - it takes practice to get better but what do you do when everything is overwhelming you? Don't worry! There's a check list for that too!</p>

         <p>Four very helpful general principles for dealing with any distressing emotions:</p>
         <ol> 
           <li>Know when you are not in pain.</li>
           <li>Do not feel bad about feeling bad.</li>
           <li>Do not feed the monsters.</li>
           <li>Start every thought with kindness and humor.</li>
         </ol>

         <p>And dealing even more! Triggers. Oh we all have those people or situations in our lives that make us blow something completely out of proportion. How to deal with them? Here you go!</p>

         <ol>
           <li>Stop.</li>
           <li>Breathe.</li>
           <li>Notice.</li>
           <li>Reflect.</li>
           <li>Respond.</li>
           <li>Scream into a pillow.</li>
         </ol>

         <p>You can't always accomplish this stuff so in the times when stuff goes buts remember to be nicer to yo self! Hug it out.</p>

         <h4>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h4>
         <p>I've been feeling guilty because I haven't been as mindful this week as I should have been. And I'm starting to feel it. But by taking one deep breath a day and thinking. "This moment today is for my me and my mindfulness" I find that I don't go crazy at least. Yet...</p>
