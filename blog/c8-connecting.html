                <h3>Connect the dots</h3>

                <h4>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h4>
                <p>Yes but not consciously on the most part. But I have been in a few situations where the '5 Dysfunctions of a Team' were fiercely present. If there is one thing that those experiences taught me it's that without Trust (in which I would include the benefit of the doubt) everything goes to hell. I could have really used those techniques then.</p>

                <h4>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h4>
                <p>Emphatic listening 'Just Like Me' exercises are something that I find waaay too easy to do. I slip easily into identifying with whomever I'm talking with without realizing. But the judgey psycho analysis listening is something I've been subjected to a lot! I think those experiences of people going all Freudian on you is really common pattern for people to slip into without realizing and it's the main reason that I lean more heavily towards the emphatic way of listening because I've had so many people do that to me and it kinda sucks.</p>

                <h4>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h4>
                <p>I've tried this before. I was taught this technique a few years ago as a form of forgiveness. If I'm doing a "Think well of everybody" kinda buzz I'm fine. Feeling happy. Love and peace to all. If I have to do this exercise with specific people in mind I will start off ok. Yeah, first person cool. Second person OK. Then slowly I go down this dark path where I'm bring up past hurts, failings, betrayals - nek minit, I've gone full blown Darth Vader. Yeah... So I don't tend to do that exercise cause I get all "Join the dark side!".</p>

                <h4>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</h4>
                <strong>Context</strong>
                <p>This is a very regular legit polar point of view occurrence at my place between my partner Francis and I. Like for real this happens ALL the time. Francis wants a cookie or whatever. By 'A' cookie he means 99% of the packet. He wants to eat all the cookies. I want to save some for another day. And I can't eat ALL the cookies in a single sitting let alone in a 5 min window. Spoiler Alert: All the cookies were eaten.</p>

                <strong>Pearl's Point of View</strong>
                <p>I want to have one or two cookies and save the rest for another day. I don't think we need to eat all the cookies right now. The cookies are quite sweet and can make you feel sick if you eat too many.</p>

                <strong>Francis' Point of View</strong>
                <p>I'm just going to eat one more. We have cookies and they should be eaten - we don't need to ration them out over the week. I mean, they're here, what are we waiting for? We should eat them. But they are just SITTING THERE! I need a COOKIE! ARRRRHHHH!!!</p>

                <p>This video is basically my life except Cookie Monster has more self control than Francis:</p>
