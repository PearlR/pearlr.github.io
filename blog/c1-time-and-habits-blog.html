                    <h3>The Terrors of Time Blocking</h3>
                    <p>I love techniques that make you more efficient but I unfortunately suck at being able to implement/stick to any of them. The entire time I was going through the time and habits links this wonderful lady kept popping into my head.</p>
                    <img src="http://i.imgur.com/TONDq.gif" alt="Nobody ain't got time for that!">
                    
                    <h5>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h5>
                    <p>The Pomodoro Technique a really cool idea but putting it into practice is so much harder then it seemed. This is basically how it went like this: 
                    <br/><br/>
                    <strong>Somewhere in the recesses of Pearl's brain...</strong> 
                    <br/><br/>
                    "Right, have all my Pomodoro's outlined for today... Start toggl." 
                    <br/><br/>
                    <strong>Half way through the exercise:</strong>
                    <br/><br/>
                    *BUZZ* Toggl says time is up! "Ahh, OK need another Pomodoro for that task, no problem." 
                    <br/><br/>
                    <strong>Some large amount of time later:</strong>
                    <br/><br/>
                    *BUZZ* Toggl says 'Don't forget to turn on your toggl! "Arrhhh crap - forgot about my timer. OK, turn you on now but have totally lost track of where my timings at."
                    <br/><br/>
                    <strong>2 minutes later:</strong> 
                    <br/><br/>
                    "Oh geez I gotta pee." 
                    <br/><br/>
                    <strong>2 mins later:</strong> 
                    <br/><br/>
                    "Oh crap forgot to toggle the toggl..."  </p>
                    </p>
                    
                    <h5>What did you find interesting?</h5>
                    <p>Everything was interesting - especially the 'Get in the zone' stuff. Most of the techniques were simple but simple is the hardest to get right. Simple is hardly ever easy. I think a more apt title for me would have been "Masocistic Time Management!"</p>

                    <h5>What worked for you?</h5>
                    <p>I found everything hard but as we learned habits need to be started small to be able to make big change. I'll keep doing the time management stuff especially and hopefully it will become easier as I become more practiced.</p>
                    <p>Oh for F*#$% sake! My toggl's not on...</p>
