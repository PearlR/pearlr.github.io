                    <h3>Do or do not. There is no try.</h3>

                    <h4>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h4>
                    <p>Ok, ok... I took great issue with this chapter when I first started reading it. Most especially the conclusion that self-confidence comes from self-knowledge and self-honesty.</p>

                    <em>"In my experience, however, the only highly sustainable source of self-confidence comes from deep self-knowledge and blatant self-honesty."</em>

                    <p>Quoted from the section "From Emotional Awareness to Self-Confidence" in Chapter 4 of Search Inside Yourself.</p>

                    <p>But the more I read and understood the connection between being mindful and being self-aware the more I started appreciate the points he was trying to make. And I definitely agree - they are important to understand and build. But my personal ethos is:</p>

                    <em>"Confidence comes from Experience. Experience comes from Working Hard." ~Pearl Robin</em>

                    <h4>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h4>
                    <p>I love body scan. Kinda reminds me of savasana in yoga. I also learned a similar technique which is actually supposed to help you go to sleep where you bring awareness to the body then pretend your body is really heavy. It basically tricks your mind/body into relaxing really quickly and helps you sleep.</p>

                    <p>The journaling is something that I didn't get to but would like to do because one of my favouritest people ever, Shawn Anchor, recommends it as one of the 5 things you should do everyday to create a mindset of happiness. Watch his video now. It's mind blowing.</p>

                    <h4>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not me" section?</h4>
                    <p>I think that title "My Emotions are Not Me" hits the nail on the head. It took me a really long time to train myself to understand the difference between recognizing what were my feelings and that I needed to separate myself from them in order to take control of them. If you are not self awareness it's easy to bumble along and fall down a rabbit hole of emotion (possible a dark hole filled with lots of self loathing emotions from coding issues perhaps?). Don't let it take over!</p>
