                    <h3>$#!&'s Getting Real</h3>

                     <h4>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h4>
                        <p>HTML and CSS are far more straight forward than JavaScript. JavaScript also uses a lot of math and logic to "process" information where HTML and CSS are far more straight forward. Definitely have needed to fasten my thinking cap on more tightly.</p>
                     <h4>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'</h4>
                        <p>Control flow refers to the order in which expressions/statements are executed in JavaScript. For example:</p>

                        <p>Cos' seriously - it's, like, all I eat at the moment.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Get a packet of 2 Minute Mee Goreng Noodles</li>
                            <li>Open 2 Minute Mee Goreng Noodles</li>
                            <li>Place 2 Minute Mee Goreng Noodles in a bowl</li>
                            <li>Add water to 2 Minute Mee Goreng Noodles until submerged</li>
                            <li>Place 2 Minute Mee Goreng Noodles bowl in the microwave</li>
                            <li>Set microwave to High for 2 minutes</li>
                            <li>Take bowl of 2 Minute Mee Goreng Noodles out of microwave</li>
                            <li>Drop hot bowl of 2 Minute Mee Goreng Noodles on floor</li>
                            <li>Burn feet with 2 Minute Mee Goreng Noodles</li>
                        </ol>
                     <h4>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals</h4>
                        
                        <h5>Arrays</h5>
                        <p>Arrays are a list of values that have order. If you're accessing data from an array you will be referencing the the spot in the array where that value sits. Arrays also have methods that you can use in order to manipulate that order such as .push();, .pop();, .shift() and .unshift().</p>

                        <h5>Objects</h5>
                        <p>An object stores data as in two parts - a property and a value. Compared to arrays - object properties/values pairs can be stored in any order. If you are accessing data you will be accessing using the property name to access the value that is attached to that property. Because each value is assigned by a property name - object properties are easy to change. Changing array values is a little more risky as you have to find the value you want to change and reference that spot where the value is sitting to change it. If the array is huge... Well, things can get messy and you could very likely change the wrong array value.</p>

                     <h4>Explain what functions are and why they are useful</h4>
                        <p>Functions are chunks of code that perform a specific task. It's basically a mini programme that can be called on to do it's job when needed. Functions are super useful because you can give them information (values, parameters, arguments) and they will give you some information back. This all happens within the little world of the function and won't mess up the rest of your code. It also means that you can make many modular parts when you're coding and if one of them is not working - it won't screw with the ones that are.</p>
